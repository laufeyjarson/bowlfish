    - Install the default sysctl.conf file instead of a custom one.
    - Updated the install script according to the changes in OpenBSD 4.4.
    - Updated the rc script to fill net.inet.(tcp|udp).baddynamic lists.

Jun 2, 2008 -- version 1.6

    - Updated the list of the files to install (install.files) in order to
      include OpenBSD 4.3's new tools, such as snmpd and relayd.
    - Imported the new kernel configuration files from flashdist.
    - Updated the rc script to start the new daemons (snmpd, relayd, ospf6d...)
    - Fixed the permissions for some files and directories in bowlfish.tgz.

Nov 22, 2007 -- version 1.5

    - Added the possibility of specifying an NTP server during installation
    - The installation procedure now prompts for the time zone and creates the
      /etc/localtime file.
    - Updated the installation script to use the (slightly) new syntax of the
      newfs(8) command.
    - Updated the rc script and the kernel config files.

May 19, 2007 -- version 1.4

    - Updated the list of files to install in order to include the new
      hoststated(8) and ripd(8) daemons and their control programs
      (hoststatectl(8) and ripctl(8) respectively).
    - Updated the /etc/rc script to include the new hoststated(8) and ripd(8)
      tools.
    - Removed kern.watchdog.auto from /etc/sysctl.conf; no need to explicitely
      set it to 1: this is the default value!
    - Now the log socket for syslogd(8) is /var/run/dev/log (set in the new
      /etc/rc.conf.local file)

Jan 27, 2007 -- version 1.3p1

    - Fixed a little bug in the custom 'rc' script that prevented the system
      from correctly starting PF.

    - BowlFish now removes the debugging symbols from libraries to save space.
    - Updated the rc script.
    - Added a few files in install.files.

Sep 3, 2006 -- version 1.2

    - Added support for GPIO: now you can use gpioctl(8) to have fun with LEDs
      and LCD displays.
    - Updated kernel config files.
    - Added a few files in install.files.
    - Fixed a bug due to a change in ldd(1) output.

Mar 24, 2006 -- version 1.1

    - The /root directory is now a read-write, in memory, directory, like /var;
      this will allow the root user to receive e-mail (though not to store it
      permanently);
    - The list of files to install from file sets is extracted to a temporary
      file instead of being passed as arguments; this will allow bowlfish to
      handle lists of files of any length.
    - Fixed a little bug in the custom 'rc' script that prevented the system
      from correctly setting sysctls on boot.


Nov 19, 2005 -- version 1.0
